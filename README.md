Exports two classes - `BaseRoll` and `BaseCreature`, for use in implementing SRD (any edition)-like game mechanics.

For background context please see the System Reference Document. There is a browsable version of the 5th edition [here](https://www.5thsrd.org/).

For possilbe uses, please see the `examples` directory.

## examples

Run the examples with:
```shell
$ node examples/<example-name>
```

Because the examples are based on algorithms with an element of chance, running the examples should give different results over multiple runs.
