Exports two classes - `BaseRoll` and `BaseCreature`, for use in implementing System Reference Document-like game mechanics.

The implementations here are generic enough that they _should_ approximate both the 3.5 & 5e editions.

For background context please see the SRD. There is a browsable version of the 5th edition [here](https://www.5thsrd.org/).

For runnable examples of (very simple) use cases, please see the `examples/` directory.

## examples

Run the examples with:
```shell
$ node examples/<example-name>
```

Because the examples are based on algorithms with an element of chance, running them will give different results over multiple runs.
